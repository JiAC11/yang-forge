# YANG version 1.0 extensions module

This module provides YANG schema language extension support for
satisfying the [RFC 6020](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6020)
specifications.

The [YANG schema](yang-v1-extensions.yang) file and the extended
language constraints and various *extension handler* routines inside
[YAML module](yang-v1-extensions.yaml) file are fused together to
construct an importable *yangforged* module.

## Current RFC 6020 Implementation Coverage

The below table provides up-to-date information about various YANG
schema language extensions and associated support within this module.
All extensions are syntactically and lexically processed already, but
the below table provides details on the status of extensions as it
pertains to how it is **processed** by the compiler for implementing
the intended behavior of each extension.

Basically, note that the *unsupported* status below indicates it is
not compliant with expected behavior although it is properly parsed
and processed by the compiler.
