# yfc -- YangForge Controller

`yfc` is the command shell for the YangForge framework, providing
schema-driven application lifecycle management.

`YangForge` provides runtime JavaScript execution based on YANG schema
modeling language as defined in IETF drafts and standards
([RFC 6020](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6020)).

Basically, the framework enables YANG schema language to *become* a
**programming** language.

It is written primarily using [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org)
and runs on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).

This software is **sponsored** by
[ClearPath Networks](http://www.clearpathnet.com) on behalf of the
[OPNFV](http://opnfv.org) (Open Platform for Network Functions
Virtualization) community.

Please note that this project is under **active development**. Be sure
to check back often as new updates are being pushed regularly.

## Installation
```bash
$ npm install -g yangforge
```

You must have `node >= 0.10.3` and `npm >= 2.0` as minimum
requirements to run `yangforge`.

## Usage
```
  Usage: yfc [options] [command]


  Commands:

    build [options] [name...]       package the application for deployment (planned)
    config                          manage application configuration data (planned)
    deploy                          deploy application into yangforge endpoint (planned)
    info [options] [name...]        show info about one or more packages
    init                            initialize package configuration
    install [options] [package...]  install one or more packages
    list [options] [package...]     list installed packages
    publish [options]               publish package to upstream registry (planned)
    run [options] [module...]       runs one or more modules and/or schemas
    schema [options]                process YANG schema files
    sign                            sign package to ensure authenticity (planned)
    *                               specify a target module to run command-line interface

  YANG driven JS application builder

  Options:

    -h, --help     output usage information
    -V, --version  output the version number
    --no-color     disable color output
```

The `yfc` command-line interface is **runtime-generated** according to
[yangforge.yang](./yangforge.yang) schema definitions.  Please refer
to the schema section covering various `rpc` extension statements and
sub-statement definitions for a reference regarding different types of
command-line arguments, descriptions, and options processing syntax.
The corresponding **actions** for each of the `rpc` extensions are
implemented inside the `YangForge` module forging before-hook
[here](src/yangforge.coffee).

## Common Usage Examples

### Using the `schema` command
```
$ yfc schema -h

  Usage: schema [options] [schema...]

  process YANG schema file(s)

  Options:

    -h, --help              output usage information
    -c, --compile           compile input file(s) into specified output format
    -e, --eval [string]     pass a string from the command line as input
    -f, --format [string]   specify output format (yaml, json) (default: yaml)
    -o, --output [string]   set the output directory for compiled schemas
```

You can `--eval` a YANG schema **string** directly for dynamic parsing:
```bash
$ yfc schema -e 'module hello-world { description "a test"; leaf hello { type string; default "world"; } }'
```
```yaml
module:
  hello-world:
    description: a test
    leaf:
      hello:
        type: string
        default: world
```
You can specify explicit output `--format` (default is YAML as above):
```bash
$ yfc schema -e 'module hello-world { description "a test"; leaf hello { type string; default "world"; } }' -f json
```
```json
{
 "module": {
   "hello-world": {
     "description": "a test",
     "leaf": {
       "hello": {
         "type": "string",
         "default": "world"
       }
     }
   }
 }
}
```
You can also `--compile` a YANG schema **file** for generating the
compiled schema output:
```bash
$ yfc schema -c examples/jukebox.yang
```
The `--compile` flag internally would invoke YANG statement resolvers,
which means that it would perform validations and dynamic expansions
of YANG extensions. Without the `--compile` flag set, the `schema`
command would only perform superficial syntax parsing.

### Using the `run` command

The real power of `YangForge` is actualized when **yangforged**
modules are run using one or more **dynamic interface
generators**.

```bash
$ yfc run -h

  Usage: run [options] [module...]

  runs one or more modules and/or schemas

  Options:

    -h, --help          output usage information
    --cli               enables commmand-line-interface
    --express [number]  enables express web server on a specified port (default: 5000)
    --restjson          enables REST/JSON interface (default: true)
    --autodoc           enables auto-generated documentation interface (default: false)
```

#### Built-in interface generators

name | description | dependency
--- | --- | ---
[cli](src/features/cli.litcoffee) | generates command-line interface | none
[express](src/features/express.litcoffee) | generates HTTP/HTTPS web server instance | none
[restjson](src/features/restjson.litcoffee) | generates REST/JSON web services interface | express
[autodoc](src/features/autodoc.litcoffee) | generates self-documentation interface | express

You can click on the *name* entry above for reference
documentation on each interface feature.

#### Running a dynamically *compiled* schema instance

You can `run` a YANG schema **file** and instantiate it immediately:
```bash
$ yfc run examples/jukebox.yang
express: listening on 5000
restjson: binding forgery to /restjson
```
Once it's running, you can issue HTTP calls:
```bash
$ curl localhost:5000/restjson/example-jukebox
```
```json
{
  "example-jukebox": {
    "jukebox": {
      "library": {
        "artist": []
      },
      "player": {},
      "playlist": []
    }
  }
}
```

The `restjson` interface dynamically routes nested module/container hierarchy:
```bash
$ curl localhost:5000/restjson/example-jukebox/jukebox
```
```json
{
  "library": {
    "artist": []
  },
  "player": {},
  "playlist": []
}
```

#### Running a *yangforged* module

You can run a *forged* module (packaged with code behaviors) as follows:
```bash
$ yfc run examples/ping
express: listening on 5000
restjson: binding forgery to /restjson
```
The example `ping` module for this section is available [here](examples/ping).

Once it's running, you can issue HTTP REPORT call to discover
capabilities of the [ping](examples/ping) module:
```bash
$ curl -X REPORT localhost:5000/restjson/ping
```
```json
{
  "name": "ping",
  "schema": {
    "prefix": "ping",
    "namespace": "urn:opendaylight:ping",
    "revision": {
      "2013-09-11": {
        "description": "TCP ping module"
      }
    }
  },
  "package": {
    "name": "ping",
    "description": "an example ping yangforged module",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "license": "MIT",
    "author": "Peter Lee <peter@intercloud.net>",
    "exports": {
      "extension": 63,
      "rpc": [
        "send-echo"
      ]
    }
  },
  "operations": {
    "send-echo": "Send TCP ECHO request"
  }
}
```
You can get usage info on an available RPC call with OPTIONS:
```bash
$ curl -X OPTIONS localhost:5000/restjson/ping/send-echo
```
The below output provides details on the expected
`input/output` schema for invoking the RPC call.
```json
{
  "POST": {
    "input": {
      "destination": {
        "type": "inet:ipv4-address",
        "config": true,
        "required": false,
        "unique": false,
        "private": false
      }
    },
    "output": {
      "echo-result": {
        "config": true,
        "required": false,
        "unique": false,
        "private": false,
        "type": "enumeration",
        "enum": {
          "reachable": {
            "value": "0",
            "description": "Received reply"
          },
          "unreachable": {
            "value": "1",
            "description": "No reply during timeout"
          },
          "error": {
            "value": "2",
            "description": "Error happened"
          }
        },
        "description": "Result types"
      }
    },
    "description": "Send TCP ECHO request"
  }
}
```
You can then try out the available RPC call as follows:
```bash
$ curl -X POST localhost:5000/restjson/ping/send-echo -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "destination": "8.8.8.8" }'
```
```json
{
  "echo-result": "reachable"
}
```

#### Running *arbitrary* mix of modules

The `run` command allows you to pass in as many modules as you want to
instantiate. The following example will also *listen* on a different
port.
```bash
$ yfc run --express 5050 examples/jukebox.yang examples/ping
express: listening on 5050
restjson: binding forgery to /restjson
```
**Coming Soon:**
Currently, the `run` command expects target schema(s) and module(s) to
be available in the local system. With the *planned* introduction of
various lifecycle management facilities (e.g. build, deploy, install,
publish) the `run` command will be extended to also perform automatic
`install` of the target schema/module by querying the `yangforge`
public registry (https://yangforge.intercloud.net).

#### Running `YangForge` natively as a stand-alone instance

When you issue `run` without any target module(s) as argument, it runs
the internal `YangForge` module using defaults:

```bash
$ yfc run
express: listening on 5000
restjson: binding forgery to /restjson
```

Once it's running, you can inquire about its capabilities by issuing
HTTP REPORT call (similar output available via CLI using `yfc info`):

```bash
$ curl -X REPORT localhost:5000/restjson
```
```json

    "defuse": "discard requested target module(s) from current runtime",
    "export": "export existing target module for remote execution"
  }
}
```

There are now a handful of *new operations* available in the context
of the `express/restjson` interface that was previously hidden in the
`cli` interface.

The `enable/disable` operations allow runtime control of various
features to be toggled on/off. Additionally, by utilizing
`infuse/defuse` operations, you can **dynamically** load/unload
modules into the runtime context. This capability allows the
`yangforge` instance to operate as an agent which can run any
*arbitrary* schema/module instance on-demand. With the *planned*
introduction of lifecycle management features, it will be possible to
swap-in new modules from the public registry without requring any
restart of the `yangforge` running instance.

The `run` command internally utilizes the `infuse` operation to
instantiate the initial running process.

## Bundled YANG modules

There are a number of YANG schema modules commonly referenced and utilized by other YANG modules during schema definition and they have been *bundled* together into the `yangforge` package for convenience.  All you need to do is to `import <module name>` from your YANG schema and they will be retrieved/resolved automatically.

name | description | reference
--- | --- | ---
[complex-types](yang/complex-types) | extensions to model complex types and typed instance identifiers | RFC-6095
[iana-crypt-hash](yang/iana-crypt-hash) | typedef for storing passwords using a hash function | RFC-7317
[ietf-inet-types](yang/ietf-inet-types) | collection of generally useful types for Internet addresses | RFC-6991
[ietf-yang-types](yang/ietf-yang-types) | collection of generally useful derived data types | RFC-6991

Additional YANG modules will be bundled into the `yangforge` package over time. Since `yangforge` facilitate *forging* of new YANG modules and easily using them in your own projects, only industry standards based YANG schema modules will be considered for native bundling at this time.

## Using YangForge Programmatically (Advanced)

```coffeescript
Forge = require 'yangforge'
module.exports = Forge.new module
```

### Key Features

* **Parse** YANG schema files and generate runtime JavaScript semantic object tree hierarchy
* **Import/Export** capabilities to load modules using customizable
  importers based on regular expressions and custom import
  routines. Ability to serialize module meta data into JSON format
  that is portable across systems. Also exports serialized JS
  functions as part of export meta data.
* **Runtime Generation** allows compiler to directly create a live JS
  class object definition so that it can be instantiated via `new`
  keyword and used immediately
* **Dynamic Extensions** enable compiler to be configured with
  alternative `resolver` functions to change the behavior of produced
  output

[YangForge](src/yangforge.litcoffee) itself is also a YANG schema
([yangforge.yang](./yangforge.yang)) **compiled** module. It is
compiled by the [yang-compiler](src/compiler/compiler.litcoffee) and
natively includes
[yang-v1-extensions](yang/yang-v1-extensions) submodule for
supporting the YANG version 1.0
([RFC 6020](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6020)) specifications.
Please reference the
[yang-v1-extensions](yang/yang-v1-extensions) module for
up-to-date info on YANG 1.0 language coverage status. It serves as a
good reference for writing new compilers, custom extensions, custom
importers, among other things.

### Programmatic Usage Examples

The below examples can be executed using CoffeeScript REPL by running
`coffee` at the command-line from the top-directory of this repo.

Using the native YangForge instance:
```coffeescript
Forge = require 'yangforge'

schema = """
  module hello-world {
    description "a test";
    leaf hello { type string; default "world"; }
  }
  """
  
forgery = new Forge
HelloWorld = forgery.compile schema
test = new HelloWorld
console.log test.get 'hello-world.hello'
test.set 'hello-world.hello', 'there'
console.log test.get 'hello-world.hello'
```

Forging a new module for build/publish (at a new package directory,
see also [complex-types](yang/complex-types)):
```coffeescript
Forge = require 'yangforge'
module.exports = Forge.new module,
  before: ->
    # series of before-compile operations
  after: ->
    # series of after-compile operations
```

Forging a new interface generator (see also
[cli example](src/features/cli.coffee)):
```coffeescript
Forge = require 'yangforge'
module.exports = Forge.Interface 
  name: 'some-new-interface'
  description: 'Some new awesome interface'
  generator: ->
    # code logic to dynamically construct a new interface based on passed-in context
    # this = an instance of Forge
    console.log this
```

There are many other ways of interacting with the module's class
object as well as the instantiated class.

**More examples coming soon!**
